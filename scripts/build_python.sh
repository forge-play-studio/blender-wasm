# two internal globals added in expat 2.6 are NOT in its rename list, so both
# copies export them and the final Blender link dies with

#   wasm-ld: error: duplicate symbol: _INTERNAL_trim_to_complete_utf8_characters
# Finish the rename the header started. Idempotent: fetch_extract reuses an
# already-extracted tree, so guard on our own marker.
